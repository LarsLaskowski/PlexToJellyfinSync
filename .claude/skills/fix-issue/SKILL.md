name: fix-issue
description: Takes a GitHub issue number, fixes the issue in the codebase, creates a branch, opens a pull request that closes the issue, and switches back to main. Use this whenever the user wants an issue resolved end-to-end, e.g. "fix issue 42", "work on #42", or passes a bare issue number to be handled.
---

Use this skill when the user gives you a GitHub issue number (e.g. "fix issue 42", "#42", or just "42")
and wants it resolved end-to-end: understand the issue, implement the fix, and publish it as a pull
request.

All user-facing output you create — branch name, commit message, PR title and body, and any code
comments or UI text — must be written in **English**, regardless of the language the user wrote in.
Never mention Claude, Anthropic, Copilot, or any other AI/assistant in the PR title or body, and do not
add any `Co-Authored-By` trailer, "Generated with" footer, session link, or other note attributing the
work to an AI.

## Workflow

### 1. Read and understand the issue

- Confirm the issue number from the user's request. If no number was given, stop and ask for one.
- Fetch the issue with GitHub CLI (non-interactive):
  `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,state,comments`
- Read the title, body, and comments to understand what is actually being asked. If the issue is
  already `closed`, stop and report that instead of starting work.
- If the issue is ambiguous, underspecified, or could be solved several materially different ways, ask
  the user a focused clarifying question before writing code. Do not guess on decisions that are
  expensive to reverse.

### 2. Prepare a clean starting point

- Verify the working tree is clean with `git status --short --branch`. If there are unrelated
  uncommitted changes, stop and report them — do not bundle them into this fix.
- Make sure you start from an up-to-date base branch (`main` unless the user says otherwise): switch to
  it and `git pull` so the branch and PR are based on current code.
- Confirm the `origin` remote exists.
- Run `dotnet restore PlexToJellyfinSync.slnx` to confirm a working baseline.

### 3. Create the branch

- Derive the branch type from the issue labels and content: use `fix/` for bugs, `feat/` for new
  functionality, `chore/`/`docs/`/`build/` where appropriate.
- Name the branch `<type>/<number>-<short-kebab-slug>`, e.g. `fix/42-nfo-path-mapping`. If the user
  supplied a branch name, use theirs.
- Create and switch to the branch from the base branch.

### 4. Implement the fix

- Solve the issue following the conventions in `CLAUDE.md`. In particular: file-scoped namespaces;
  `using` outside the namespace (System first); Allman braces; `var` preferred; language keywords over
  BCL types; LINQ method syntax only; `== false` instead of `!`; `is null`/`is not null`; no primary
  constructors; constructor injection with `_camelCase` readonly fields; `.ConfigureAwait(false)` in
  `Service`/`Data` code; XML docs in English with no `<remarks>`.
- Wrap every type's members in `#region` blocks **as you write the code**, grouped by member kind
  (`Constants`, `Fields`, `Constructors`, `Properties`, `Events`, `Methods`, …); never add regions only
  after an analyzer warning.
- Add new NuGet packages only through **Central Package Management** (`Directory.Packages.props`); do
  not put version numbers in individual `.csproj` files.
- Keep changes small and targeted; reuse existing helpers before adding abstractions. Respect the
  existing project layout: `PlexToJellyfinSync.Core` (interfaces/enums/options/models),
  `PlexToJellyfinSync.Data` (Plex DTOs), `PlexToJellyfinSync.Service` (PlexClient, NfoWriter,
  PathMapper, WatchAggregator, SyncOrchestrator, StateStore, SyncStatusService, log store/provider),
  the Blazor Server host (`Program.cs`, `Worker`, `Dashboard.razor`, `Logs.razor`), and
  `PlexToJellyfinSync.Tests` (MSTest).
- Read the surrounding code and match its style, naming, and comment density.

### 5. Format and validate

- Run `reihitsu-format ./` after editing C# and before building.
- Run `dotnet build PlexToJellyfinSync.slnx -c Release --no-restore`. The build must finish with
  **zero Reihitsu (`RH####`) warnings and errors** — treat every `RH` diagnostic as a failure and fix
  it before continuing.
- Run `dotnet test PlexToJellyfinSync.slnx -c Release --no-build`. For a tighter loop on a single test,
  use `dotnet test tests/PlexToJellyfinSync.Tests/PlexToJellyfinSync.Tests.csproj --filter
  "FullyQualifiedName~ClassName.MethodName"`.
- Add or update MSTest tests (no FluentAssertions): class `{Feature}Tests`, methods
  `{Class}{Scenario}{ExpectedResult}` in PascalCase without underscores (e.g.
  `WatchAggregatorAllWatchedReturnsWatched`), always with an assert message.
- If validation fails, fix the cause before continuing — do not push broken or unformatted code. If you
  cannot make it pass, stop and report clearly.

### 6. Commit

- Stage only the files relevant to this fix. Do not include unrelated changes.
- Write a concise commit message that matches the repo history and references the issue number (e.g.
  `Fix NFO path mapping for multi-library setups (#42)`).
- Do not add any `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any other note attributing the work to an AI/assistant.

### 7. Push and open the pull request

- Push the branch to `origin` with upstream tracking.
- Open the pull request with GitHub CLI:
  - base branch: `main`, unless the user requested a different base
  - title: concise English summary of the fix
  - body: a short English summary of the problem and the fix, and a line `Closes #<number>` so the
    issue auto-closes on merge
  - Do not add any attribution, "Generated with" footer, or other note referencing an AI/assistant in
    the PR title or body.

### 8. Finish

- After the PR is created, switch back to the base branch (`main`).
- Report the issue number, branch name, and pull request URL clearly.

## Rules

- Prefer non-interactive commands only.
- If push or PR creation fails, stop and report the failure clearly — do not continue as if it succeeded.
- Do not amend existing commits unless the user explicitly asks.
- If switching back to `main` would discard or conflict with uncommitted work, stop and explain the
  blocker.
- Never close the issue manually; let `Closes #<number>` in the PR body do it on merge.
